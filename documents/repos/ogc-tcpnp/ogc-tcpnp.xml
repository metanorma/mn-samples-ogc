"International standards" (as defined in <eref type="inline" bibitemid="ISODIR2" citeas="ISO/IEC DIR 2"/>) are those adopted by an international standardizing/standards organization and made available to the public. Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>

<p>A document, established by consensus and approved by the OGC Membership, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</p>

<p>To guide an open standards development and approval process, a member approved Policies and Procedures is required.</p>

<p>This document describes the OGC Technical Committee (TC) policies and procedures (P&amp;P). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC. The Technical Committee Chair (TCC - see <xref target="role-of-the-technical-committee-chair-tcc"/>) facilitates the TC process.</p>

<p>The TC P&amp;P:</p>

<ul><li><p>Documents all TC voting processes and procedures;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Documents the formation, scope and processes required for TC subgroup and committee activities;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Documents the processes and procedures for submitting, reviewing, and approving a new standard using the Request for Comment procedures; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Documents the process for revisions to adopted OGC® standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As the needs and purpose of the TC change, these policies and procedures changes are approved by an electronic vote of the Voting Members of OGC TC or by recommendation of the OGC Planning Committee (PC). These policies and procedures may be augmented or clarified by Policy Directives issued and approved by the TC or the PC. Such directives are databased and hyperlinked to/from the appropriate portion of this document.</p>

<p>The OGC Technical Committee provides an open, collaborative forum for professional discussion related to the consensus development and/or evaluation, approval, and revision of OGC international standards. The primary use of approved OGC standards is to provide the ability to build and deploy interoperable geospatial solutions in the larger Information Technology (IT) domain.</p>

<p>The OGC Principles of Conduct (<eref type="inline" bibitemid="OGCPOC" citeas="OGC Principles of Conduct"/>) govern personal and public interactions in any TC activity.</p>

<title>What is a Consortium?</title>

<p id="_c04ce449-5586-3785-c30b-a595ac95d53e">Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG.

Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time.

The key consideration for a Community standard submission is that there is very strong evidence of implementation. At the same time, the community owning the standard may not want to allow normative changes (except for errors) to the document, may not wish to follow the OGC Modular Specification Policy, nor do they wish to develop CITE tests. Please visit <xref target="policies-for-the-request-for-comment-rfc-process"/> and <xref target="annex-c---community-standard"/> to read more about the requirements for submitting a Community standard as well as a checklist of steps in the Community standard submission, review, and approval process.</p>

Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a standard with Compliance Suite is defined as three or more documented implementations that collectively implement all mandatory requirements of the standard.

<p id="_537143ea-7b82-7186-7b10-fb3bd5ad9d9c">Modular Specification: compliance with the Modular Specification is evidenced by inclusion of clearly defined Requirements and an Abstract Test Suite in the standard document. The OAB will evaluate a standard against this criterion.</p>

The scope of this International Standard includes the following:
-      conceptual modelling of features and their properties from a universe of discourse;
-      definition of application schemas;
-      use of the conceptual schema language for application schemas;
-      transition from the concepts in the conceptual model to the data types in the application schema;
-      integration of standardized schemas from other ISO geographic information standards with the application schema.
The following are outside the scope:
-      choice of one particular conceptual schema language for application schemas;
-      definition of any particular application schema;
-      representation of feature types and their properties in a feature catalogue;
-      representation of metadata;
-      rules for mapping one application schema to another;
-      implementation of the application schema in a computer environment;
-      computer system and application software design;
-      programming.</abstract>
