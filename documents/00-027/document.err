For some parameters there is no viable way to test if their different values are working or they are part of an asynchronous operation. To overcome this problem, their value is fixed in the request (<tt>iteratorsize=100</tt>, <tt>cursor=0</tt>, <tt>asynchronous=false</tt>, <tt>maxlevel=2</tt>, <tt>presentation=full</tt>, <tt>entrytype=collection</tt>).</p>

If a successful status is retrieved, the last check will be using the NV format, i.e., the program will check if the functionality of this method is working testing the results retrieved with NV format. If the NV format is working the present capability will be shown as supported if the number of hits retrieved is the number of hits expected by the test.</p>
