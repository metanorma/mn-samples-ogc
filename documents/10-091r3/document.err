	<p id="_d6e700ea-e790-1b42-f30f-136ee0004cff">In this section, several CF-netCDF extensions are listed which have been discussed by the CF-netCDF Working Group in the course of developing the CF-netCDF specification. Some of them are already available as adopted or proposed specifications by other groups (NASA and NOAA in particular), but nearly all of them are available as part of the netCDF packages which have been implemented and used widely for decades. The CF conventions are in fact a separate entity, but they too evolved as part of the netCDF community of practice and were initially implemented for use with netCDF. By no means is this list prescriptive or comprehensive; some extensions listed here may never be written, and others not listed at this time may be added and developed later.</p>
