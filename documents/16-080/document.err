	<title>Introduction</title>
	<p id="_e353db5b-6204-7fb2-22f7-775a5b338f9b">While over the last 10 years use of open standards compliant geospatial web services such as WMS, WMTS, WFS, WCS and CSW has grown massively, there has not been an effective open standards mechanism to assemble a collection of information such that it can be exchanged easily among a community. While some GIS vendors support such a capability the solution is typically not portable between vendors. The OGC did develop the Web Map Context standard (05-005) but this only supported WMS and so was relatively limited. The OWS Context Standard (OWC) was developed to allow advanced sharing of geospatial ‘Context’ or ‘view’ between users across a wide range of application types (browser, desktop applications, apps) and technologies (desktop, mobile, embedded etc). The standard is modular and easily implemented, and supports a wide range of OGC service standards as well as in-line or local content.</p>
	
	<p id="_505a722a-9ea7-68f5-0995-ded586c98673">OWS Context offers a solution to a wide range of sharing requirements. Chapter 1 describes a list of use case examples. Chapter 2 will provide a detailed description of each of these examples.</p>

In a collaboration built on for example an emergency response there is typically a wide range of stakeholders and a need to provide them with relevant common information. Often one person or group (typically geo-support) has the responsibility to provide a set of information to other users (in this case commanders and on-scene responders) in time sensitive situations to allow them to deal with the evolving situation; given that they do not have time to assemble information themselves. The OWS Context Document standard allows the geo-support personnel to assemble a set of relevant information, accessible via web services, and pass it to other users (by email message, file transfer or by storing it within an OGC catalogue).</p>

To do this a two existing applications are exploited to show the typical workflow. As can be seen in <xref target="applications_and_tools"/> (Applications and Tools) there are a number of other applications which support OWS context with a range of use cases, so the following example is purely one method of exploiting it.</p>

The Time Interval of Interest, like the area of interest, is not the time extent of the data, it is the time range which is expected to be of interest to the user. So if a particular event (e.g. movement of a hurricane) has a range of times where something critical happens, the time interval would be set to that range.
