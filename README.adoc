== General

This repository contains three documents converted to Metanorma
format from the OGC series, used to demonstrate usage
of Metanorma in the OGC context.

Documents shown include:

* Web Feature Service (WFS)
** Repo: https://github.com/metanorma/ogc-wfs

* Technical Committee Policies and Procedures
** Repo: https://github.com/metanorma/ogc-tcpnp


== Structure

`repos/`::
git repositories of Metanorma OGC documents (branch `gh-pages`), added as
submodules in this directory. These are the Metanorma XML documents
we need here.

`source/`::
(automatically generated) extracted Metanorma XML documents from `repos/`.
This is where the Metanorma XML documents will be processed into output
formats.

`documents/`::
(automatically generated) generated Metanorma output from XML files
in `source/`.

`published/`::
(automatically generated) published Metanorma OGC documents together
with the Relaton index (`index.html`).


== Usage

This repository uses `make` to run these processes.

To build the site, run:

[source,sh]
----
make publish
----

The resulting HTML site will be built in `published/`.



To build the documents, just run:

[source,sh]
----
make
----

This runs the `documents.html` target.




Other specific `make` targets are:

`documents.html`::
creates `documents.html` from `documents.rxl`.

`documents.rxl`::
creates `documents.rxl` from Metanorma output located in `documents/`.


=== Updating document repos

Update the submodules:

[source,sh]
----
git submodule foreach git pull
git add repos
git commit -m 'Update document repos'
----
