== Time
Time value or range is set by the TIME parameter as absolute frame numbers or as ISO time. Frame based access is efficient, TIME based access is flexible. Both forms of time are explicit and do not leave room for ambiguity. The tables below have been captured from the original document to summarize the syntax. A client can ask for image data or metadata:

. At a single instant in time
. Within a window in time, with controlled increments
. Within multiple windows in time, with controlled increments for each time window

|*value* |A single time value of as frame number or instant of time of acquisition |Get one map at this time value

|stem:[bb "value"_1,bb "value"_2, bb "value"_3] ... |A list of explicit multiple values |Get multiple maps, each at the specified time value

|*min/max/resolution* |An interval defined by its lower and upper bounds and its resolution. Lower and upper bounds are time values. |Get multiple maps, starting from min, up to and including _max_, in steps of _resolution_.

a|stem:[bb "min"_1 // bb "max"_1 // bb "res"_1,] +
stem:[bb "min"_2 // bb "max"_2 // bb "res"_2] ... |A list of multiple intervals. |Repeat the above process for multiple time intervals.

|*recurring_interval/ value/resolution* |An interval defined by a recurring time interval designator, interval start time value and its resolution. |Get a total of _recurring_interval_ maps, starting from the time value, and increment time value by resolution for each consecutive map.

a|stem:[bb "int"_1 // bb "value"_1 // bb "res"_1,] +
stem:[bb "int"_2 // bb "value"_2 // bb "res"_2] ... |A list of multiple intervals. |Repeat the above process for multiple time intervals.

|*recurring_interval/ min/max* |An interval defined by a recurring time interval designator, and by its lower and upper bounds (time values). |Get a total of _recurring_interval_ maps, starting from time value min, up to and including time value max, dispersed evenly from min to max.

|*F[FRAME]* |Get one map from frame number FRAME.
|*F[START]/F[END]/FS[STEP]* |Get multiple maps from frame number START, up to and including frame number END, incrementing the frame number from START in steps of STEP. To go backward, set END < START. STEP stem:[!=] 0.
|*R[N]/F[START]/FS[STEP]* |Get N frames starting from START, increasing each subsequent frame by STEP. STEP is an integer. STEP < 0, go backward. STEP > 0, go forward. STEP stem:[!=] 0.
|*R[N]/F[START]/F[END]* |Get a total of N frames, starting from frame START and ending at frame END. To go backwards, set END < START. N > 0.

Frame based time is efficient. It directly maps to required data. ISO time of acquisition (TOA) requires mapping the time to an absolute frame. Client's ISO time map 1:1 with a frame's TOA. If it does not, any ambiguity is resolved as specified in the "`*Temporal mismatch*`" section below.

=== ISO time based TIME
TIME parameter value is also based on ISO 8601. It is best illustrated by way of examples.
