== Collection Service
The Collection Service or CS allows a client to discover what collections of WAMI data are being served by a service implementation. See examples in <<annex-examples>>.

=== Definition of a WAMI data _Collection_
A *collection* of WAMI data is a *set* of WAMI data such that each *element* or *frame* of this set of WAMI data is temporally sequential from the previous element. An *element* or *frame* of WAMI data can be a single image or a group of images that constitute a single logical picture of an instant in time. Data storage and retrieval model is specification independent.

CS draws its structure heavily from the industry as well as multiple OGC specifications of presenting the organization of a set of maps, metadata, raster data, vector data, and video. Hierarchical data is generally presented in the form of an inverted tree structure. In computer science a tree is a widely-used data structure that emulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of linked nodes. For the purpose of this specification, a *Collection Tree* is a data structure that is an _ordered directed tree_, more specifically arborescence: a connected acyclic graph where each node has zero or more _children_ nodes and at most one parent node. Furthermore, the children of each node have a specific order.

A node is a structure which may contain a value, a condition or represent a separate data structure. A _childnode_ is hierarchically below a node and a node that has a child is the _parentnode_ of that child. Nodes without children are _leaf nodes_ or _terminal nodes_. Nodes with children are also known as _inner nodes_. The first node of the tree has zero parent nodes and is the _root node_. A connection between nodes is called an _edge_ or a _link_. The path from the root node to any node is unique and may be traversed through the links. Each collection (as defined above), is unique from all other collections.

In the figure, you can also see a possible organizational structure that may get used practically.
