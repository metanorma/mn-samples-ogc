== Introduction

The Earth Observation _Exploitation Platform Hackathon 2018_ was organized by OGC at the European Space Agency Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, on May 3rd and 4th. Sponsored by ESA and NRCan, the goal of the Hackathon was to evaluate results from the recently concluded Testbed-13 initiative. Testbed-13 produced three Engineering Reports to describe a standards-based approach for deploying arbitrary applications on cloud platforms.

* http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-023.html[OGC Testbed-13: Exploitation Platform Application Package (OGC 17-023)] describes a container format that describes applications packaged in a Docker container in sufficient detail to allow their automated deployment and execution on cloud platforms.

* http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-024.html[OGC Testbed-13: Application Deployment and Execution Service (OGC 17-024)] describes how applications that have been described according to the Application Package specification are actually deployed and executed on cloud platforms.

* http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-035.html,[OGC Testbed-13: Cloud (OGC 17-035)] provided further background on EO applications and cloud platforms in general.

In particular the first two Engineering Reports state several alternatives and provide recommendations on the preferred approach very carefully only. The full architecture is described best in <<Simonis2018>> Thus, the Hackathon was organized to experiment with the alternatives and to give room for additional approaches suggested by Hackathon participants.

=== The Challenge

The challenge was rather straight forward: Take an arbitrary application, store this application in a Docker container, describe this application with the necessary detail to allow standards-based automated deployment and execution, and then register this application with a Web service that allows executing the workflow publicly. Then, pretend to be another user, execute the application in the cloud and access the results.

=== Use Case

The implemented use case is briefly outlined here and described in full detail in chapter <<Implementation_Challange_UseCase, Implementation Challenge, section UseCase>>. The use case describes a burn scare mapping scenario in Canada, where the extent of wild fires is analyzed based on radar data processing. The use case required to process a collection of Sentinel-1 radar data for the Northwest Territories (NWT) at the beginning and the end of the 2017 summer. Large wildfires occurred in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in this region, and the application should allow spatially-extensive, timely and cost effective wildfire mapping and monitoring to better assess post-fire burns and tracking of impacts of disturbances on forestlands.

anada’s forests cover an area of 348 million hectares, which is 35% of Canada’s land area and 9% of the world’s forested area. Because vast areas are inaccessible, researchers use satellites such as Sentinel-1 to gain valuable insights into Canada’s forest ecosystem. The Hackathon evaluated the extent of wild fires based on Sentinel-1 data for the summer of 2017 over the Northwest Territories, Canada. In total, 128 Sentinel-1 IW images (832 GB) for the two coverages (beginning and end of summer 2017) of the entire NWT had to be processed.

=== What was provided

Organizers provided the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) Software Toolbox together with a pre-defined workflow packaged in a Docker container. Hackathon participants could use the Docker container "as is", i.e., there was no need to modify the container or the application. Given that the container included both SNAP and an executable SNAP graph, participants could on the hand execute the application independently of the available Docker image to test alternatives to the Testbed-13 solutions.

The SNAP workflow in the Docker container required two types of data: Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and Sentinel-1 data. Both have been made available to the participants as cloud resources. Natural Resources Canada provided a Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) for terrain correction due to lack of SRTM over 60° North, ESA provided 128 Sentinel-1 scenes.

=== Requested Solution

The requested solution is defined in full detail in chapter <<Implementation_Challange, Implementation Challenge>> and only briefly outlined here. The requested solution was based on the Testbed-13 results, which are illustrated in the figure below and briefly described in the following paragraphs. There was no exclusiveness, though. Participants could develop their own solution that deviated from the Testbed-13 base.

.Testbed-13 Architecture

The application developer in the upper left corner packages the application together with all required libraries into a Docker container (1) and describes it following the Application Package specification (2). The Application Package will then be registered with the Application Deployment and Execution Services, ADES (3). The ADES provides a WPS interface. The ADES registers the new application and makes it available as a new WPS process. On request from an application consumer (4), the ADES provides a description of all parameters required to be provided as part of an execution request. On execution (6), the ADES deploys the application container on a cloud and executes it. Once done, the application consumer is provided with instructions on how to access the results. The discovery process of the new process (5) that allows the discovery of the new process in a catalog service is ignored in the Hackathon.

=== Possible Deviation

Participants have been free to deviate from the architecture outlined above as long as the following requirements are met:

* the application developer can make an application available in a container to the cloud platform;

* the application can be executed with a simple WPS execute() request, i.e., mounts the input data to the Docker mount points automatically, downloads necessary data, executes all processing steps, stores the results persistently on the cloud, and informs the user upon completion of the process; and

* any consumer can discover the application and request its deployment and execution in the cloud.
