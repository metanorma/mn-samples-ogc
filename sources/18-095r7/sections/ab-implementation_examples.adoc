== Data cube implementation examples

=== Introduction

This Annex includes non-normative examples of data cube implementations that adhere
to most of the items in the body of this document. The implementations are listed in an
order that balances historical development and listing data cubes that meet the body of
the text higher in the order.


=== OpenDataCube (Previously the Australian Geoscience Data Cube)

The Open Data Cube provides an integrated gridded data analysis environment for
decades of analysis ready earth observation satellite and related data from multiple
satellite and other acquisition systems [<<CEOS_2018>>].

The Open Data Cube is a system designed to:

* Catalogue large amounts of Earth Observation data;
* Provide a Python based API for high performance querying and data access;
* Give scientists and other users easy ability to perform Exploratory Data Analysis;
* Allow scalable continent scale processing of the stored data; and
* Track the provenance of all the contained data to allow for quality control and
updates.

The Open Data Cube provides these APIs and community developed extensions:

* Loading Data from a Cube
* Searching and Indexing Datasets
* Model
* Bit Masking
* Analytics and Execution Engines
* Array IO on Amazon S3
* WMS and WCS
* WPS
* QGIS integration
* A UI for visualising its contents
* A UI for executing queries
* For *Exploratory Data Analysis* see Datacube Class for more details
* For *Writing Large Scale Workflows* see GridWorkflow Class for more details


=== EarthServer-2 project

The EU FP7 EarthServer and EU H2020-funded EarthServer-2 [<<EarthServer_2017>>]
projects have set up WCSs for different scientific domains: ocean science, earth
observation, climate science and planetary science. The architectural setup follows the
web services concept and bases on rasdaman (http://rasdaman.org/), an intelligent arraybased
server technology, in combination with the OGC standard protocol WCS. Four
WCSs are exploring the possibilities and challenges of providing access to data sizes
beyond 1 PB of 3D to 4D Earth Science Data [<<Wagemann_2017>>] .

* Marine Science Data Service (http://earthserver.pml.ac.uk/) is developed by the
Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) and makes available multiple hundred
terabytes of ocean color data, produced by ESA’s climate change initiative (CCI).
The service will further offer Sentinel-3 data once the data products are
disseminated.
* Climate Science Data Service was developed by ECMWF to demonstrate the
ability to provide access to multiple petabytes of ERA-Interim reanalysis data
(Dee et al. 2011) stored in ECMWF’s archive. This was achieved by serving data
from the Meteorological and Archival System (MARS archive) via a web service
in a standardized way. The service was discontinued after the end of the project.
* Earth Observation (EO) Data Service (http://eodataservice.org/) is jointly
developed by MEEO s.r.l. and the National Computing Infrastructure (NCI)
Australia. The service will offer EO data from the Sentinel family, primarily data
from Sentinel-2 satellites. NCI will eventually offer a WCS for multiple hundreds
of terabytes of Landsat data.
* .Planetary Science Data Service (http://planetserver.eu/) is developed by the
Jacobs University Bremen and will provide access to tens of TB of data
(topographic, multi- and hyperspectral) of the solar system bodies Mars, Mercury
and Moon.

Since 2012, the intercontinental EarthServer initiative (http://www.earthserver.eu) is
establishing agile data cube analytics on 3D x/y/t image timeseries and 4D x/y/z/t
weather data, based on the rasdaman Array Database System (http://www.rasdaman.org).
The largest installation, EO Data Service (www.eodataservice.org), recently has passed
the 1 Petabyte [<<Strobl_2017>>].

Data cube assets of 2.5 PB have been federated intercontinentally, and single queries
have been parallelized across more than 1,000 cloud nodes. As such, the EarthServer
initiative is one of the large-scale proofs of practicality for WCS and, specifically,
WCPS.

One success or activity, establishing a private/public datacube partnership, is the German
funded project BigDataCube [<<Misev_2018>>]. Aside from routinely using the rasdaman
federation capabilities it puts particular emphasis on versatile access control, down to the
level of single pixels.


=== rasdaman

Following its invention of data cube services [<<Baumann_1992>>], the rasdaman team since
then has architected the rasdaman scalable datacube engine for cross-domain management
and server-side processing of massive n-D arrays. The rasdaman declarative datacube
analytics language allows any query, any time, on any size, ready for extraction, filtering,
processing, analytics, distributed datacube fusion, and Artificial Intelligence.
Through the OGC WMS, WCS, and WCPS standards rasdaman supports regular and irregular
spatio-temporal grids. The open-source rasdaman engine is OGC WCS reference
implementation, and the rasdaman query language has been standardized in the ISO SQL
array extension. As the currently only tool rasdaman supports transparent federation on
planetary scale. Individual nodes retain autonomy, with security configurable down to
single pixel level.

The rasdaman architecture is a full-stack implementation in fast C++, with every component
optimized for arrays. A series of highly effective techniques boosts array query
execution, including: adaptive partitioning, just-in-time compilation into machine code,
heterogeneous CPU/GPU hardware support, intelligent query optimizations, parallelization
and distribution (without single point of failure), and federated processing. Queries
have been split across more than 1,000 Amazon cloud nodes.

Storage utilizes transparent tiling into sub-arrays maintained in some database (like PostgreSQL)
or directly in the file system (about 2x faster), always using rasdaman’s
optimized storage methods. Any tiling can be configured by the admin, as one of the
many tuning parameters in an easy-to-use, OGC based ETL tool. Additionally, rasdaman
can tap into any pre-existing archive by just registering files rather than copying them.

With Athena Research’s FeMME extension, rasdaman allows integrated data and metadata
search, thereby establishing a seamless integration of catalogs with datacubes. Users
always remain in the comfort zone of their well-known tools – rasdaman supports a large
and growing number of visual and API clients, including OpenLayers, Leaflet, QGIS,
ArcGIS, NASA WebWorldWind, Cesium, C++, Java, python, and R.

User-friendly, flexible, fast, scalable, and standards-conformant datacube services become
a commodity with rasdaman: providers enjoy simple deployment and maintenance,
users enjoy the massively simplified access, visualization, and analysis capabilities not
requiring any programming skills. A series of innovation awards, most recently the
NATO Defence Innovation Award 2018, acknowledges the rasdaman innovation.

=== EOX Sentinel-2 cloudless

Sentinel-2 cloudless (https://s2maps.eu) is a yearly series of global sunny homogeneous
10m satellite maps. It combines trillions of pixels collected during differing weather
conditions over a whole year and merges them into a mosaic, almost free from
atmospheric impacts. The mosaics are provided via Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) as
well as Web Map Service (WMS) under a Creative Commons license (2016 CC-BY;
newer CC-BY-NC-SA). A WCS interface is provided.

Sentinel-2 cloudless is the global visualization product of the EOxCloudless product
family (https://cloudless.eox.at) that provides off-the-shelf or custom tailored mosaics as
Data Cubes. In its simplest form the mosaics are provided as numerous GeoTIFFs in a
pyramid structure following the WMTS tilematrixset definition (see this blog post for
details https://eox.at/2018/01/visualizing-geotiff-tiles-with-openlayers/). Off-the-shelf mosaics
contain 4 bands (8- or 16-bits) but custom mosaics may include any number of bands as
well as potentially a metadata band allowing tracing back to individual input satellite
images on a per-pixel basis. These GeoTIFFs can be loaded in a simple HTTP server or a
more complex server software like the Open Data Cube. The Open Source library
geotiff.js (https://geotiffjs.github.io) for example allows exploration and analysis of GeoTIFFs
directly in the browser like for example shown in the COG-Explorer
(https://geotiffjs.github.io/cog-explorer) demonstration.

=== Advanced geospatial Data Management platform (ADAM)

The Advanced geospatial Data Management platform (ADAM) is a platform that
implements the Digital Earth concept: ADAM allows accessing to large variety of multiyear
global geospatial collections allowing data discovery, visualization, combination,
processing and download. ADAM allows exploiting data from global to local scale.

The core of ADAM is a Data Access System (DAS), a software module that manages a
large variety of geospatial information featuring different data formats, geographic /
geometric and time resolution The DAS exposes OGC standardized Open Search and
Web Coverage Service (WCS 2.x) interfaces that allow discovering available collections
and subset them in any dimension with a single query. Thus, ADAM provides an
effective subsetting functionality that accesses the data only when requested and serves to
the client only the data amount that is really needed.

ADAM is a very modular platform: various DAS are deployed on different data sources
(e.g. different DIAS, AWS, MEEO Data Facility, etc.), allowing accessing and subsetting
the available collections without downloading / duplicating the data.

ADAM, referred also as a virtual datacube technology, enables seamless access to all
available data collections through a single interface; cutting the access barriers to a large
variety of data (no need to know the exact for-mat of any of the available products) it
saves data preparation time and facilitates the simultaneous use of data coming from
different sources.

ADAM exposes three user interfaces to satisfy the needs (and match with the skills) of a
large variety of users:

* A web based graphic user interface (Explorer) and a mobile application (ADAM
Mobile);
* A web-based notebook (Jupyter Notebook); and
* OGC standardized REST interfaces: OpenSearch for data discovery, WCS 2.x for
data access).


=== Euro Data Cube

The Euro Data Cube (EDC, https://eurodatacube.com) is the cube service for global Earth
Observation (EO) data exploitation. The objective of EDC is to provide users with
functionality to query and exploit large volumes of EO data and information resources,
with a scheme that promotes open data sharing and reselling. The EDC ensures the
storage and online availability of data in the form of multi-dimensional arrays suitable for
retrieving, analyzing, and correlating EO information resources, based on innovative
interfaces and interoperability standards.

<<figure_9>> shows a high-level architecture of the EDC offerings highlighting the data and
information flow from the EO and Non-EO data offerings on the left over the data cube
building blocks and service interfaces to the user on the right.

The top arrow shows EDC's Client Data Processing Engine (CDPE), supporting clientside processing of Cloud-optimized GeoTiffs (COGs) directly in the web browser.

The on-the-fly data cube access service as well as the asynchronous mass processing
service are powered by Sentinel Hub (http://www.sentinel-hub.com).


Sentinel Hub is a satellite imagery processing service, which is capable of on-the-fly
gridding, re-projection, mosaicking, compositing and other actions required for efficient
fetching of data for end-users, either for integration in web-applications, where pictures
are mostly served, or in machine learning and similar analysis processes, where pixel
values and statistics are essential. The service works with original satellite data files and
does not require replication or pre-processing. It uses cloud infrastructure like CreoDIAS,
Mundi Web Services, ONDA, or AWS and innovative methods to efficiently process and
distribute data in a matter of seconds. It provides catalog service, data processing and
rendering service, custom scripting engine including open-source custom scripts library
on top of Sentinel-1 GRD, Sentinel-2 (L1C and L2A), Sentinel-3 (OLCI & SLSTR),
Sentinel-5P, Landsat-5, -7, -8, Envisat MERIS, and MODIS data as well as Planet and
SPOT data on demand.

Versatile pre-generated data cubes are provided by the Open Source Python package
xcube. It is based on xarray just like the CEOS Open Data Cube, Pangeo, and other
leading data cube initiatives.

The EDC provides the integrated power of Sentinel Hub and xcube via one API in an
enhanced end-to-end service. The services are provided via an API following the
OpenAPI approach (process, statistics) as well as OGC standards to the extent feasible
(mainly WMS, WMTS, WCS, WPS).

The EDC aims to contribute to adoption and further evolution of open interfaces
particularly of OGC standards, mainly the Web Coverage Service (WCS) but also the
forthcoming OGC API Coverages. The EDC further intends to be interoperable with the
CEOS supported "Open Data Cube" Open Source initiative by contributing to the OGC
web services interoperability layer.

The Euro Data Cube is a joint service offering by Sinergise, Brockmann Consult, EOX,
Gisat, Planet, and Sentinel Hub VAS. ESA has awarded a contract to European industry
leaders to build the EDC facility service, ensuring its openness through a standardization
path with OGC and will act initially as "anchor tenant" being also a main customer of the
service.


=== PCI Geomatics Tools for OpenDataCube implementation and data preparation
