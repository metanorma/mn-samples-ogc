== Analytics: Queries and Access

The significant value of data cubes services is the ability to perform analytics that meet
user needs. Key to the value is that the user need not have detailed knowledge of the
source data structure and observation artifacts. This section defines Geospatial Coverage
Data Cube analytics in terms of data access methods and queries.


[[req_5]]
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
model:: ogc
type:: general
label:: https://opengeospatial.org/bp/datacubes/Req05

A Geospatial Coverage Data Cube Service shall support analytics on all domain axes alike, irrespective of the nature of the dimension, e.g. spatial or temporal.
====


In the past, most standards as well as implementations had dedicated methods for spatial
extraction and different ones for temporal extraction. Data cubes, on the contrary, offer
the single concept of spatial-temporal axis described by ornamenting metadata. After
such a unifying step, trimming and slicing (see <<figure_2>>) can follow the same syntax
along all axes. Note that this is not withstanding different units of measure - Latitude
might be measured in degrees like 42°30’, time in days like 2017-06-06, height in flight
levels like FL100.


[[req_6]]
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
model:: ogc
type:: general
label:: https://opengeospatial.org/bp/datacubes/Req06

A Geospatial Coverage Data Cube Service shall allow efficient trimming and slicing along any number of axes from a data cube in a single request by the user.
====


[[req_7]]
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
model:: ogc
type:: general
label:: https://opengeospatial.org/bp/datacubes/Req07

A Geospatial Coverage Data Cube Service shall not allow requests that require excessive resources, responding to the user with an estimate of the resource requirements and/or recommendations on how to reduce resources.
====


Operations on a data cube can be trim or slice operations or other analytics. Users from most Earth Science communities are interested in performing both request types efficiently and fast [<<Wagemann_2017>>].

* Trimming: a cut-out of the same dimensionality (e.g., a regional subset of a larger
multiband image).
*  Slice: a subset of reduced dimensionality (e.g., a single band from a multiband
image, or a time series of feature values at a single location).
*  Trimming and slicing can be combined in a single request.

[[req_8]]
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
model:: ogc
type:: general
label:: https://opengeospatial.org/bp/datacubes/Req08

A Geospatial Coverage Data Cube Service shall allow tuning of performance to anticipated user query patterns.
====

Traditional storage, for example, has been optimized for horizontal access, penalizing
temporal and vertical extraction.

Data cubes should support dimension neutrality: meaning that the complexity of a
specific processing request (e.g., a query) does not depend on the dimensions involved in
the request. Data cubes should expose the dataset in a way that assure dimension
neutrality [<<Stefano_2017>>].

This document makes no quantitative performance requirements. The emphasis is on
functionality. Optimization as a capability shall be supported.


[[req_9]]
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
model:: ogc
type:: general
label:: https://opengeospatial.org/bp/datacubes/Req09

A Geospatial Coverage Data Cube Service shall provide server-side analytic processing on the data including composite extraction, processing, filtering, and fusion tasks in an ad-hoc fashion.
====


Different Earth Science disciplines require processing operations of different kinds. The
climate science community, for example, is interested in generating anomalies and
averages of data over a certain period of time. For the vegetation community, the query
language defined in Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) is very useful to do band
calculation, for example, to calculate on-demand the Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI) of a satellite image [<<Wagemann_2017>>]. WCPS is also useful for spatiotemporal
statistics, etc.

Data cubes may need to do regridding and reprojection on the fly based on the datasets
and the user requirements. Gridding to a common projection and tiling system comes
with loss of original product information. As a single grid may not be suitable for the
community’s purposes, a datacube service may need to perform a regridding and
reprojection on the fly.
