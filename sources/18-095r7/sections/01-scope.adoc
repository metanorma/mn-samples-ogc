== Scope

This document describes community practices for Geospatial Coverage Data Cubes as
implemented by multiple communities and running as operational systems. An objective
of this document is to promote coordination and common terminology leading to the
possibility to federate data cube services.

This Community Practice represents a specific approach to making geospatial data
available using open standards. Other approaches for geospatial data cubes, e.g.,
different data structures and access methods, will be investigated in OGC based on this
Community Practice and other perspectives including promising research and innovative
implementations.
