== Information model: Geospatial Coverages

To support analytics, a data cube shall use an information model that minimizes artifacts
of how the data was created or acquired and support analytics on the information model
that are of value to analysts. The Geographic Coverage concept provides such an
information model. A Geographic Coverage associates positions within a bounded space
(its domain) to attribute values (its range). <<OGC_2006>>.

To be clear, this Community Practice defines three related concepts:

* Data Cube
** Multi-dimensional ("n-D") array of values. Even though it is called a 'cube', it
can be 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, or higher-dimensional.
* Geospatial Coverage Data Cube
** A Data Cube established on basis of a Coverage with a specific grid system
for geospatial data with at least one dimension of spatial or temporal
definition.
* Geospatial Data Coverage Cube Service
** Online service that provides access and analytics on Geospatial Data Cubes.

Although the name "`data cube`" suggests a 3-dimensional model, the geospatial data cube
model is not restricted to that. The spectrum of dimensions includes 1-D sensor data, 2-D
imagery, 3-D x/y/t image time-series and x/y/z subsurface voxel data, and 4-D x/y/z/t
climate and ocean data cubes.

For the temporal dimension, a temporal coordinate system is required. A temporal
coordinate system measures time system based on an interval scale on which distance is
measured as a multiple of a single unit of time. Ordinal temporal reference systems and
calendars need not be supported.

A Geospatial Data Cube shall use the Geographic Coverage model as defined in OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS).

The Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) specification [<<OGC_2017>>] establishes a
concrete, interoperable, conformance-testable Coverage. CIS is based on the abstract
concepts of OGC Abstract Topic 6 [<<OGC_2006>>]. CIS is interoperable in the sense that
coverages can be conformance tested, regardless of their data format encoding, down to
the level of single "`pixels`" or "`voxels.`" CIS provides for grids such as shown in <<figure_1>>
including combinations of regular and irregular axis; and showing grids over time as a
vertical axis.

As defined in CIS, the domain set of a Coverage determines the exact locations of a
coverage overall and its set of direct positions. The domain set is defined through an
ordered list of axes whose lower and upper bounds establish the extent along each axis.
The axis sequence and their meaning is defined by the CRS. This domain set CRS is
called the coverageâ€™s Native CRS. CIS supports all CRSs including Euclidean and
spherical, and geographic. CRSs maybe defined by identifier and listing in a registry,
e.g., EPSG, or by custom definition of the CRS.

Additionally, some redundant information is present in the domain set for efficiency
reasons: the number of dimensions, axis labels, and UoM (Unit of Measure) labels
simplify parsing the coverage as the parser does not have to retrieve the CRS definition,
such as from the OGC CRS resolver at http://www.opengis.net/def/crs and
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-compound.

As defined in CIS, the RangeType component adds a structure description and technical
metadata required for an appropriate (however, application independent) understanding
of a coverage. For this structure description, the SWE Common DataRecord [<<OGC_2011>>]
is used. Optionally, interpolation directives can be added.

The CIS standard does not require uniform time. CIS Clause 8.2 on Irregular
independent grid axes states that time axis may be irregular, e.g., supporting arbitrary
image acquisition time.

Coverages can be encoded in any suitable format (such as GML, JSON, GeoTIFF,
NetCDF, HDF) and can be partitioned, e.g., for a time-interleaved representation.
Coverages are independent from service definitions and, therefore, can be accessed
through a variety of OGC services types, such as the Web Coverage Service (WCS)
standards suite (see [<<Baumann_2018>>] for an introduction). The coverage structure
can serve a wide range of coverage application domains, thereby contributing to
harmonization and interoperability between and across these domains.
