== Further developments

This section identifies topics that may affect the future development of Geospatial
Coverage Data Cube services.


=== Federation of Data Cubes

Geospatial Coverage Data Cubes can be an important step toward establishing a common
analytical framework to link very large, multi-resolution and multi-domain datasets
together for analysis. The Geospatial Coverage Data Cube defined in this paper provides
the basis for a network of data cubes operating on large geoscientific and geospatial
datasets to address global as well as national challenges [Lewis 2017].

Data cubes are being established at Global, Regional, and National level, as in particular
Regional and National data owners are constrained to publish their data on infrastructures
on their territory. At the thematic level, it can be expected that different operators will
appear and will want to operate their own instance of a data cube. Also, in this distributed
scenario, applications shall be able to combine data layers held in different data cube
instances, even if based on different technologies.

Federation of datacubes introduces location transparency of data sets hosted by geographically
disparate data providers, as well as their processing. This offers several distinct advantages
for users.

* Enhanced offering: Users can access the sum of all individual offerings of the
participating data providers.
* Location transparency: When accessing a dataset, users can send the request to
any federation member â€“ users do not need to know the location of a particular
data set. In other words, the federation offers a common, flat information space.
* Remote fusion: When combining two or more data sets in a request (such as a
WCPS query) the federation partners determine an efficient way of solving this
request and execute the request accordingly, without any extra client intervention.
In other words, users get returned only the result requested, without any need for own source data download, reformatting, and processing.


Such federations have been implemented on rasdaman datacubes, demonstrated in EarthServer-2 [<<EarthServer_2017>>] on Petascale through intercontinental transparent
federation connecting ECMWF/UK and NCI/Australia. Further, the German Sentinel
hub, CODE-DE, is federated with an ESA DIAS and continuously being extended with
further federation partners, including commercial offerings.

=== DGGS for Data Cubes

"`Datacubes: A Discrete Global Grid Systems Perspective`" [<<Purss_2019>>] discusses options
and how it is possible to implement a data cube based on discrete global grid systems,
while using the same topologies as conventional data cubes. These provide a flexible
spatial data infrastructure that leverages the same topological advantages as conventional
geospatial data cubes, while reducing barriers to data interoperability of both raster and
vector data and providing additional functionality. Also, they potentially provide a very
efficient approach to connecting to big data sources in order to extract datasets on
demand prior to proceeding to multi-level intelligent big data processing, mining,
machine learning, and visualizations.

The OGC DGGS Abstract Specification Topic 21 [<<DGGS_2017>>] defines a DGGS as a
spatial reference system that uses a hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and
address the globe. DGGS are characterized by the properties of their cell structure, geoencoding,
quantization strategy, and associated mathematical functions. The OGC
DGGS Abstract Specification supports the specification of standardized DGGS
infrastructures that enable the integrated analysis of very large, multi-source, multiresolution,
multi-dimensional, distributed geospatial data.

Data cubes can benefit from an underlying DGGS compliant data tiling and integration
scheme as defined by the OGC DGGS specification. A data cube based on a DGGS
enforces a more comprehensive set of spatial boundaries to the problem of global spatial
data representation and integration. Further developments of DGGS aim to enable data
cubes to be federated at a truly global scale, without the spatial limitations and constraints
imposed by heterogenous data cubes.


=== Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) coverages

Coverages as defined in CIS1.1 can describe the atmosphere (or ocean) as a
multidimensional 4D cube that contains parameters, e.g., temperature, wind, humidity
(salinity), etc. Coverages are defined by (axis) dimensions that can contain one of more
of these meteorological/ oceanographic parameters. A typical Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) forecast simulation may be expressed as a set of 2D coverages, often,
but not always based on rectified grids. A typical model run contains thousands of 2D
files. This situation is managed by identifying, where possible, "`4D Coverages`" from
many 2D files, as shown in <<figure_6>>. [Met/Ocean 2018]

=== OGC APIs for geospatial resources

OGC is defining web-friendly APIs that can be used to access geospatial and location
information in any domain. This major evolution in the OGC Standards Baseline is
underway is currently underway with the development of several standards:

* OGC API-Features
* OGC API-Coverages
* OGC API-Maps
* OGC API-Tiles
* OGC API-Processes
* OGC API-Common

The OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web
APIs and be web-friendly for non-geospatial experts. The APIs are designed to allow
developers to reuse and extend the APIs for any domain. The first consensus adoption of
the OGC API-Features Core was published on 2019-10-14.

The OGC APIs are being developed using OpenAPI, GitHub, and Hackathons. OpenAPI
is a standard, programming-language-agnostic interface description for Web APIs which
allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a
service. OGC uses GitHub as a collaborative platform for specification development and
for OpenAPI artifacts. Hackathons are conducted to implement and test draft API
specifications. Along with the Specifications, OGC members are developing Reference
Implementations, Compliance Testing, e-Learning, and Outreach materials.

Once the OGC APIs specifications have been further developed, their relevance to the
Geospatial Data Cubes can be better evaluated.

The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification is being developed in
coordination with the OGC APIs. The STAC specification aims to standardize the way
geospatial assets are exposed online and queried. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that
represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time. The initial
focus is primarily remotely-sensed optical imagery (from satellites, but also planes,
drones, balloons, etc.), but the core is designed to be extensible to SAR, full motion
video, point clouds, hyperspectral, LiDAR and derived data like NDVI, Digital Elevation
Models, mosaics, etc.

=== Array Analytics

Several approaches to APIs for analytics are discussed in <<scls_10-2>>. OGC held a
Coverage and Processing Analytics Sprint in January 2020 to investigate the further
development of technologies for analytic interoperability on data cubes, such as:

* Jupyter notebooks and Python scripting language
* Array Databases, e.g., ISO IS 9075-15 SQL/MDA (Multi-Dimensional Arrays)
* xarray, GeoXarray, ZARR
* application of R scripting language for statistics to data cubes, e.g. [<<Appel_2019>>]
* OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) Language Interface Standard [<<WCPS_2009>>]
* OGC API - Coverages
