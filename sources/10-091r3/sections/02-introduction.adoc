== Introduction

The CF-netCDF standard defines how to encode digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena.

CF-netCDF consists of a set of normative specifications, collectively referred to as “the CFnetCDF suite”. These specifications encompass:

* netCDF Core <<ogc10-090r3>>
* netCDF Classic Binary Encoding Extension Standard: NetCDF Classic and 64-bit Offset Format <<ogc10-092r3>>
* As noted in this later in this document, additional Extensions to the Core that may be specified in the future. In particular, submission of a CF-netCDF Conventions Extension Standard [OGC 10-093] is planned for the near future.

This document provides an overview on the CF-netCDF encoding suite by describing CF-netCDF core and extensions. As such, the content of this document is informative and not normative.
