== Data model

The data model used by the binary encoding is equivalent to that used by the CSV encoding. <<fig1>> shows an example for trajectories of three moving points stem:[A], stem:[B] and stem:[C]. Each trajectory has the same start time and the same end time.

* At stem:[t = 0] (start of all data), all points start moving.
* At stem:[t = 1], the movement of stem:[A] is changed.
* At stem:[t = 2] (end of all data), the movement of stem:[A], stem:[B] and stem:[C] are changed.

In the case, the trajectory of stem:[A] from stem:[t = 0] to stem:[t = 1] and from stem:[t = 1] to stem:[t = 2] is encoded, together with the trajectories of stem:[B] and stem:[C] from stem:[t = 0] to stem:[t = 2].
