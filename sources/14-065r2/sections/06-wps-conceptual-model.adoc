== WPS Conceptual Model
The WPS service model defines basic properties of any WPS server. A WPS server is a web service that provides access to pre-defined processes and provides job control operations to instantiate, control and monitor processing jobs (<<fig-artifacts-of-the-wps>>).

=== Service Discovery
Any WPS server shall be self-contained, i.e. provide an initial endpoint that can be used by a WPS client to determine the server's capabilities.

====

=== Service Capabilities
The basic capabilities of any WPS server fall into two categories: The first category comprises capabilities for process discovery and retrieval of process descriptions. The second category comprises capabilities to manage and monitor processing jobs.

Since the processes provided by a WPS server may have different degrees of complexity, the server shall indicate the allowed job control capabilities mode per process offering.

Further service capabilities, i.e. for secure communication and user authentication may be provided with the service but are neither covered nor restricted by this specification as long as they do not alter or change the semantics of other job control capabilities.

[[subsec-abstract-process-model]]
=== Abstract Process Model
The abstract process model specifies generic requirements for process offerings that can be used in conjunction with WPS. Processes, as well as their inputs and outputs, are elements with identity. A process input may have arbitrarily defined value cardinality, i.e. for a given input, multiple datasets may be submitted for execution. A process output always has a value cardinality of one. Process inputs and outputs may also be nested. Identifiers for inputs and outputs shall be unique. For nested children it is sufficient to have a unique nesting path. Any input and output that does not have child elements shall have a defined data type so that a client is aware of the valid data formats for process execution.

The abstract process model provides many degrees of freedom for process descriptions. However, it does not enforce additional complexity for very simple processes.

=== Job Control
The execution capability, that permits WPS clients to instantiate and run processing jobs, is the most prominent job control capability. Furthermore, the ability to dismiss or delete a job is useful for long-running processes in order to release server resources.

======

======

====



=== Process Execution
Process executions on a WPS server may be run either synchronously (<<fig-synchronous-process-excution-uml>>) or asynchronously (see <<fig-asynchronous-process-execution-uml>>). Synchronous execution is a suitable approach for jobs that take a relatively short time footnote:[Short and long are relative terms and requires considerations on both client and server side and the application context. This specification does not give any guidelines regarding what short or long means. There may also be an architectural consideration that suggests either synchronous or asynchronous communication.] to complete. Asynchronous execution is preferable for jobs that may take a long time to complete.

In the synchronous case, a WPS client submits an execute request to the WPS server and keeps listening for a response until the processing job has completed and the processing result has been returned. This requires a persistent connection between client and server.

[[fig-synchronous-process-excution-uml]]
.Synchronous process execution UML sequence diagram
image::fig-synchronous-process-excution-uml.png[]

In the asynchronous case, the client sends an execute request to the WPS server and immediately receives a status information response. This information confirms that the request was received and accepted by the server and that a processing job has been created and will be run in the future. The status information response also contains a processing job identifier that is used by the client when checking to see if execution has completed. (The client may also manage the processing job using available steering capabilities.) In addition, the status information response contains the result location, i.e. the URL where the processing result can be found after the processing job has completed.

=== Data Transmission by Value and by Reference
Data exchange between WPS clients and servers requires an agreement on the general data exchange patterns and suitable communication protocols. This specification defines two general data transmission modes for data exchange between WPS client and server.

Clients may send input data to or receive output data from a process in two distinct ways: (1) by reference, and (2) by value (see <<fig-execute-call-and-response>>). For brevity, this figure only shows the transmission patterns in the pure form, i.e. the same pattern is used for all inputs and outputs. However, mixed patterns are possible. Typically, small or atomic data such as integers, doubles or short strings are submitted by value. Large data inputs (outputs) are usually supplied by reference.

[[fig-execute-call-and-response]]
.Execute call and response "`by value`" and "`by reference`" UML sequence diagram.
image::fig-execute-call-and-response.png[]

This specification makes no assumptions about the encoding of the transmitted data. Due to the variety of data formats and supplementary encoding procedures, the receiver may not be able to automatically detect the data format. The set of encoding attributes that may be used by the receiver to decode inline or directly referenced data is defined by the data format description (see <<tab-data-encoding-properties>>).

=== Job Monitoring
By definition, a processing job is a server-side object created by a processing service in response for a particular process execution. It is comprised of a process definition (i.e. one of the process offerings defined in the WPS server's capabilities), the input data provided or specified by the WPS client, and the outputs that are eventually delivered when the job has been completed.

Since the processing job is a server-side object, a WPS client has no means to inspect the status of a job on its own. Therefore, the server should provide a unique identifier for each job. For privacy, it is recommended to keep this identifier confidential between client and server.

For jobs running in asynchronous mode, the WPS server shall also provide monitoring information and it may also contain estimates on the completion time or additional elements related to status polling.

If a client finds a polling time in the status information, it shall respect it and behave accordingly. The service may rely on the client polling roughly around this time to obtain updated status information.

If a client finds an expiry date in the status information, it shall respect it and behave accordingly, i.e. ensure that the execution result is evaluated on time and the outputs are retrieved before the job is removed from the server. This requirement allows for robust WPS implementations and the timely re-allocation of server resources.

This section also defines a basic status set to communicate the status of a server-side job to the client. Extensions of this specification may introduce additional states for fine-grained monitoring or domain-specific purposes.
