== Dismiss Extension
The dismiss extension for WPS allows a client to communicate to the server that he is no longer interested in the results of a job. In this case, the server may free all associated resources and "`forget`" the JobID (<<fig-dismiss-operation-uml>>). For jobs that are still running, the server may cancel the execution at any time. For jobs that were already finished, the associated status information and the stored results may be deleted without further notice, regardless of the expiration time given in the last status report.

=== Dismiss Operation
The dismiss operation is a job control operation. Its availability is indicated per process using the jobControlOptions in the ProcessSummary and the ProcessOffering structures.
