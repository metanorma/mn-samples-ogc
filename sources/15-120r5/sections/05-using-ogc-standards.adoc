The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) developed the Joint Training Data Services (JTDS) to support rapid scenario generation for the U.S. DoD M&S training community. The recently developed (2014) and deployed JTDS Common Terrain Generation Service (C-TGS) is a cloud-based service for the war fighter. C-TGS provides a robust capability to search, discover and retrieve Modeling and Simulation (M&S) terrain data. JTDS based the CB-TGS standard data structure on OGC-approved formats served by OGC Web Services. The goal for the Terrain Generation Service (TGS): Eliminate the current paradigm where every simulation uses a different proprietary format. Current data efforts are fraught with simulation issues and errors, and data mining, correlation and processing to support multiple simulation formats is manpower intensive.

The TGS Solution: Have a repository and user interface that provides access to a single source of data through a persistent web service AND set and enforce a standard data structure based on industry standard Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) approved formats, to normalize terrain data across Force Development simulations.

The above figure represents the implementation architecture for CB-TGS. Implementation software represents a mix of commercial/proprietary and open source. At the heart of the C-TGS are two data stores: A CDB structured data store and a 3d model data store. All applications at the Visualization and Dissemination level interface the data stores via OGC service interfaces.

Connecting OGC Web Services to an open, simulation-optimized terrain data store, such as a CDB structured data store, results in high-end performance for serving and rendering geospatial content, the ability to dynamically modify terrain and support for all levels of simulation. a high-end simulation system using CDB can dynamically update the terrain (such as a bomb crater) and have that dynamically updated terrain instantly served by the Geospatial Discovery Service to any OGC compliant system, such as Esri(R) ArcMap, QGIS, or a mobile web page. The underlying architecture and framework of the C-TGS provide a mechanism to move high-end simulation to the point where data sharing, crowd-sourcing, and dynamic terrain are in-sync with GIS tools and simulation system edits of the terrain repository.
