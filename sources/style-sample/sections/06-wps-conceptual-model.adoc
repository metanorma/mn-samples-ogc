== WPS Conceptual Model
The WPS service model defines basic properties of any WPS server. A WPS server is a web service that provides access to pre-defined processes and provides job control operations to instantiate, control and monitor processing jobs (<<fig-artifacts-of-the-wps>>).

=== Service Discovery
Any WPS server shall be self-contained, i.e. provide an initial endpoint that can be used by a WPS client to determine the server's capabilities.

[requirement,type="general",label="/req/conceptual-model/discovery/endpoint"]
======
All WPS servers shall have an initial end-point (HTTP URI).
======

[requirement,type="general",label="/req/conceptual-model/discovery/capabilities"]
======
The service shall provide a systematic discovery mechanism for all service capabilities.
======

[requirement,type="general",label="/req/conceptual-model/discovery/mechanism"]
======
The discovery mechanism for the service capabilities shall be predictable from the initial endpoint.
======

====

=== Service Capabilities
The basic capabilities of any WPS server fall into two categories: The first category comprises capabilities for process discovery and retrieval of process descriptions. The second category comprises capabilities to manage and monitor processing jobs.

Since the processes provided by a WPS server may have different degrees of complexity, the server shall indicate the allowed job control capabilities mode per process offering.

Further service capabilities, i.e. for secure communication and user authentication may be provided with the service but are neither covered nor restricted by this specification as long as they do not alter or change the semantics of other job control capabilities.

All process offerings shall provide an identifier for their process model used.
