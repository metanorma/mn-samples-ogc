== Requirements class "OpenAPI 3.0"

[[two_approaches_oas]]
=== Basic requirements

Servers conforming to this requirements class define their API by an https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#oasDocument[OpenAPI Document].

inherit:[<<openapi,OpenAPI Specification 3.0.2>>]
====

[[req_oas30_oas_definition_1]]
[.requirement,label="/req/oas30/oas-definition-1"]
====
[.requirement]
======
An OpenAPI definition in JSON using the media type `application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0` and a HTML version of the API definition using the media type `text/html` SHALL be available.
======
====



The requirements <<req_core_root_success,/req/core/root-success>> and <<req_core_api_definition_success,/req/core/api-definition-success>> in _Core_ require that the API definition documents are referenced from the landing page.

[[req_oas30_oas_definition_2]]
[.requirement,label="/req/oas30/oas-definition-2"]
====
[.requirement]
======
The JSON representation SHALL conform to the <<openapi,OpenAPI Specification, version 3.0>>.
======
====

OpenAPI definitions can be created using different approaches. A typical example is the representation of the feature collections. One approach is to use a path parameter `collectionId`, i.e., the API definition has only a single path entry for all feature collections. Another approach is to explicitly define each feature collection in a separate path and without a path parameter, which allows to specify filter parameters or explicit feature schemas per feature collection. Both approaches are valid.

[[req_oas30_oas_impl]]
[.requirement,label="/req/oas30/oas-impl"]
====
[.requirement]
======
The server SHALL implement all capabilities specified in the OpenAPI definition.
======
====

=== Complete definition

[[req_oas30_completeness]]
[.requirement,label="/req/oas30/completeness"]
====
[.requirement]
======
The OpenAPI definition SHALL specify for each operation all https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#httpCodes[HTTP Status Codes] and https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Objects] that the server uses in responses.
======
[.requirement]
======
This includes the successful execution of an operation as well as all error situations that originate from the server.
======
====

Note that servers that, for example, are access-controlled (see <<security,Security>>), support web cache validation, CORS or that use HTTP redirection will make use of additional HTTP status codes beyond regular codes such as `200` for successful GET requests and `400`, `404` or `500` for error situations. See <<http_status_codes,HTTP status codes>>.

Clients have to be prepared to receive responses not documented in the OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

=== Exceptions

[[req_oas30_exceptions_codes]]
[.requirement,label="/req/oas30/exceptions-codes"]
====
[.requirement]
======
For error situations that originate from the server, the API definition SHALL cover all applicable HTTP Status Codes.
======

[[security]]
=== Security

[[req_oas30_security]]
[.requirement,label="/req/oas30/security"]
====
[.requirement]
======
For cases, where the operations of the server are access-controlled, the security scheme(s) SHALL be documented in the OpenAPI definition.
======
====

The OpenAPI specification currently supports the following https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#security-scheme-object[security schemes]:

* HTTP authentication,

* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),

* OAuth2â€™s common flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and

* OpenID Connect Discovery.

=== Features

[.recommendation,label="/rec/oas30/f-key-properties"]
====
[.recommendation]
======
The schema for the Response Objects of the HTTP GET operation for features SHOULD include key feature properties of the features in that feature collection.

This is particularly helpful if filter parameters are defined for the collection (see recommendation `/rec/core/fc-filters`).
