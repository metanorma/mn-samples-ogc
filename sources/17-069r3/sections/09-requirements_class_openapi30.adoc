== Requirements class "OpenAPI 3.0"

[[two_approaches_oas]]
=== Basic requirements

Servers conforming to this requirements class define their API by an https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#oasDocument[OpenAPI Document].

[[req_oas30_oas_definition_1]]
[%unnumbered]
|===
^.^h| Requirement 45 h| /req/oas30/oas-definition-1
^.^| A | An OpenAPI definition in JSON using the media type `application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0` and a HTML version of the API definition using the media type `text/html` SHALL be available.
|===

The requirements <<req_core_root_success,/req/core/root-success>> and <<req_core_api_definition_success,/req/core/api-definition-success>> in _Core_ require that the API definition documents are referenced from the landing page.

[[req_oas30_oas_definition_2]]
[%unnumbered]
|===
^.^h| Requirement 46 h| /req/oas30/oas-definition-2
^.^| A | The JSON representation SHALL conform to the <<openapi,OpenAPI Specification, version 3.0>>.
|===

OpenAPI definitions can be created using different approaches. A typical example is the representation of the feature collections. One approach is to use a path parameter `collectionId`, i.e., the API definition has only a single path entry for all feature collections. Another approach is to explicitly define each feature collection in a separate path and without a path parameter, which allows to specify filter parameters or explicit feature schemas per feature collection. Both approaches are valid.

[[req_oas30_oas_impl]]
[%unnumbered]
|===
^.^h| Requirement 47 h| /req/oas30/oas-impl
^.^| A | The server SHALL implement all capabilities specified in the OpenAPI definition.
|===

=== Complete definition

[[req_oas30_completeness]]
[%unnumbered]
|===
^.^h| Requirement 48 h| /req/oas30/completeness
^.^| A | The OpenAPI definition SHALL specify for each operation all https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#httpCodes[HTTP Status Codes] and https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Objects] that the server uses in responses.
^.^| B | This includes the successful execution of an operation as well as all error situations that originate from the server.
|===

Note that servers that, for example, are access-controlled (see <<security,Security>>), support web cache validation, CORS or that use HTTP redirection will make use of additional HTTP status codes beyond regular codes such as `200` for successful GET requests and `400`, `404` or `500` for error situations. See <<http_status_codes,HTTP status codes>>.

Clients have to be prepared to receive responses not documented in the OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

=== Exceptions

[[req_oas30_exceptions_codes]]

|===
^.^h| Requirement 49 h| /req/oas30/exceptions-codes
^.^| A | For error situations that originate from the server, the API definition SHALL cover all applicable HTTP Status Codes.

[[security]]
=== Security

[[req_oas30_security]]
[%unnumbered]
|===
^.^h| Requirement 50 h| /req/oas30/security
^.^| A | For cases, where the operations of the server are access-controlled, the security scheme(s) SHALL be documented in the OpenAPI definition.
|===

The OpenAPI specification currently supports the following https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#security-scheme-object[security schemes]:

* HTTP authentication,

* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),

* OAuth2â€™s common flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and

* OpenID Connect Discovery.

=== Features

[%unnumbered]
|===
^.^h| Recommendation 17 h| /rec/oas30/f-key-properties
^.^| A a| The schema for the Response Objects of the HTTP GET operation for features SHOULD include key feature properties of the features in that feature collection. +
This is particularly helpful if filter parameters are defined for the collection (see recommendation `/rec/core/fc-filters`).
