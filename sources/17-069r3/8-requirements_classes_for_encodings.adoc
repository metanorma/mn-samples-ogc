== Requirements classes for encodings

=== Overview

This clause specifies four pre-defined requirements classes for encodings to be used by a OGC API Features implementation. These encodings are commonly used encodings for spatial data on the web:

* <<rc_html,HTML>>

* <<rc_geojson,GeoJSON>>

* <<rc_gmlsf0,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 0>>

* <<rc_gmlsf2,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 2>>

None of these encodings are mandatory and an implementation of the <<rc_core,Core>> requirements class may also implement none of them but implement another encoding instead.

The <<rc_core,Core>> requirements class includes recommendations to support <<rc_html,HTML>> and <<rc_geojson,GeoJSON>> as encodings, where practical. <<overview_cl6,Clause 6 (Overview)>> includes a discussion about recommended encodings.

=== Requirements Class "HTML"

Geographic information that is only accessible in formats like GeoJSON or GML has two issues:

* The data is not discoverable using the most common mechanism for discovering information, that is the search engines of the Web;

* The data can not be viewed directly in a browser - additional tools are required to view the data.

Therefore, sharing data on the Web should include publication in HTML. To be consistent with the Web, it should be done in a way that enables users and search engines to access all data.

This is discussed in detail in https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#indexable-by-search-engines[Best Practice 2: Make your spatial data indexable by search engines [SDWBP]]. This standard therefore <<rc_html,recommends supporting HTML as an encoding>>.

GeoJSON is a commonly used format that is simple to understand and well supported by tools and software libraries. Since most Web developers are comfortable with using a JSON-based format supporting GeoJSON is recommended, if the feature data can be represented in GeoJSON for the intended use.

Templates for the definition of the schemas for the GeoJSON responses in OpenAPI definitions are available at http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/featureCollectionGeoJSON.yaml[featureCollectionGeoJSON.yaml] and http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/featureGeoJSON.yaml[featureGeoJSON.yaml]. These are generic schemas that do not include any application schema information about specific feature types or their properties.

=== Requirements Class "Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 0"

In addition to HTML and GeoJSON, a significant volume of feature data is available in XML-based formats, notably GML. Therefore, this standard specifies requirements classes for GML. The Simple Features Profile, Level 0, is the simplest profile of GML and is typically supported by tools.

The GML Simple Features Profile is restricted to data with 2D geometries with linear/planar interpolation (points, line strings, polygons). In addition, the Level 0 profile is limited to features that can be stored in a tabular data structure.

^.^| C | If a property `numberReturned` is included in the response, its value SHALL be reported using an HTTP header named `OGC-NumberReturned`.
^.^| D | If links are included in the response, each link SHALL be reported using an HTTP header named `Link` (see <<rfc8288,RFC 8288, Clause 3>>).

.Media types and XML elements for each resource

h| Resource h| Path h| XML root element
| Landing page | `/` | `core:LandingPage`
| Conformance declaration | `/conformance` | `core:ConformsTo`
| Feature collections | `/collections` | `core:Collections`
| Feature collection | `/collections/{collectionId}` | `core:Collections`, with just one entry for the collection `collectionId`
| Features | `/collections/{collectionId}/items` | `sf:FeatureCollection`
| Feature | `/collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}` | substitutable for `gml:AbstractFeature`
|===

The namespace prefixes used above and in the OGC API Features Core XML schemas are:

* `core`: `http://www.opengis.net/ogcapi-features-1/1.0`

* `sf`: `http://www.opengis.net/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/sf`

* `gml`: `http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2`

* `atom`: `http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom`

* `xlink`: `http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink`

The mapping of the content from the responses specified in the <<rc_core,Core requirements class>> to the XML is straightforward. All links have to be encoded as HTTP header `Link`.

See <<examples>> for links to example responses in XML.

=== Requirements Class "Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 2"

The difference between this requirements class and the <<rc_gmlsf0,Level 0>> requirements class is that non-spatial feature properties are not restricted to atomic values (strings, numbers, etc.).
